//Done    1) Sort out collisions between player and AI so that they do not merge together and restrict movement. --STATUS: DONE, needs refining
          2) Refine line of sight so that it takes walls into account.
          3) Tidy up code (low priority at the moment).
//Done 	  4) Look into further optimising the search algorithm, at the moment there can be a noticeable stutter in frames when it goes into effect. --stutter put down to debug code printing to console
//Partial 5) Read Access Violation when deleting pointers to Node. Likely due to Raw Pointers, make needed adjustments. --STATUS: DONE, for pathfinding. should look into changing other raw pointers
          6) Make the aesthetic more dynamic and interesting for the test demo.

1) Sort out collisions between player and AI so that they do not merge together and restrict movement.
2) Refine line of sight so that it takes walls into account.
3) Tidy up code (low priority at the moment).

5) Read Access Violation when deleting pointers to Node. Likely due to Raw Pointers, make needed adjustments.
